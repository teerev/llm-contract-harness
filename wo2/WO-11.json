  "notes": "Read ALL the provided context files to understand the project. Write a README.md that includes: (1) a project title and one-paragraph description, (2) installation instructions (just 'pip install' is not needed — it's a standalone package, just mention Python 3.10+), (3) CLI usage section showing 'python -m mazegen' with all flags (read cli.py to get the exact arguments), (4) at least two concrete CLI examples: one generating a maze, one generating and solving, (5) a brief Python API section showing how to use generate(), solve(), and render_ascii() programmatically, (6) a note that all outputs are deterministic given the same seed. Keep it concise and accurate — do not invent features that don't exist in the source. All other files are context-only — do NOT modify them."
