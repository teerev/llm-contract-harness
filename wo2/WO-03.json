  "notes": "Use typing.NamedTuple for all three types. Position has fields: row (int), col (int). Maze has fields: width (int) — number of columns, height (int) — number of rows, seed (int) — RNG seed used for generation, start (Position) — entry cell, end (Position) — exit cell, passages (frozenset) — frozenset of (Position, Position) tuples representing open connections between adjacent cells where the first Position is always less than the second (lexicographic order by row then col). Solution has fields: found (bool) — True if a path exists, path (tuple) — tuple of Position objects from start to end; empty tuple if not found. No methods, no defaults, no validation — just plain immutable data containers."
