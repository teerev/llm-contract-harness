 Sudoku solver and puzzle generator. The solver should use constraint propagation + backtracking; the generator should produce puzzles with a unique solution and adjustable difficulty (roughly: easy/medium/hard). Provide a CLI to solve a puzzle from a string or file and to generate a new puzzle. Include tests for solver correctness on a few known puzzles and uniqueness checks for generated puzzles (within reasonable limits).
