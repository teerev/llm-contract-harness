Build a terminal-based word guessing game similar to Hangman. The program should choose a word from a small built-in word list, display masked letters, accept single-letter guesses, track already-guessed letters, and end the game when the word is fully revealed or a maximum number of incorrect guesses is reached. Do not draw ASCII art; focus on the logic. Structure the code so that word selection, guess processing, and game state are cleanly separated. Include tests for guess handling and win/loss detection.
