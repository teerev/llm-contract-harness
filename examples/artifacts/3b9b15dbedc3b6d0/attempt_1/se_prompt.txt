You are a software engineer. Propose DIRECT FILE WRITES to implement the requested changes.

## Work Order
Title: Define core data types (Grammar and Segment)
Intent: Create lsysviz/types.py defining the Grammar and Segment data types that all subsequent modules will depend on.

## Allowed Files (you may ONLY write to these paths)
  - lsysviz/types.py

## Forbidden
  - Do not modify any existing files
  - Do not add any behavior or logic beyond type definitions

## Notes
Use typing.NamedTuple for both types. Grammar has fields: axiom (str) and rules (dict[str, str]) where keys are single characters and values are replacement strings. Segment has fields: x0 (float), y0 (float), x1 (float), y1 (float) representing a line segment endpoint pair. No methods, no defaults, no validation — just plain immutable data containers.

## Current File Contents
Use the sha256 shown below as the `base_sha256` value in your writes.
For files that do not exist yet, use the sha256 of empty bytes: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855

### lsysviz/types.py
exists: False
sha256: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
(empty / does not exist)

## Required Output Format (STRICT — no deviations)
Output ONLY a single JSON object with exactly two keys:
  "summary"  — a brief description of what you changed
  "writes"   — an array of objects, each with:
      "path"        — relative file path (must be in allowed files)
      "base_sha256" — hex SHA256 of the file's current content (from the sha256 values shown above)
      "content"     — the COMPLETE new file content as a string

Do NOT wrap the JSON in markdown fences or add any other text.
Every write must contain the FULL file content, not a partial edit.
