## Work Order
Title: Implement turtle geometry interpreter
Intent: Create lsysviz/turtle.py with a pure function that converts an L-system string into a list of line segments using turtle-graphics interpretation.

## Allowed Files (you may ONLY write to these paths)
  - lsysviz/turtle.py
  - lsysviz/types.py

## Forbidden
  - Do not modify lsysviz/types.py
  - Do not modify any other existing files

## Notes
Define: interpret(lstring: str, angle_deg: float, step_length: float) -> list[Segment]. The turtle starts at position (0.0, 0.0) heading 90 degrees (straight up in standard math coordinates). Supported commands: 'F' = move forward by step_length in current heading direction and record a Segment from old position to new position; '+' = turn left (counter-clockwise) by angle_deg; '-' = turn right (clockwise) by angle_deg; '[' = push current position and heading onto a stack; ']' = pop position and heading from the stack. All other characters are silently ignored. The function must be pure and deterministic. Do NOT modify lsysviz/types.py.

## Current File Contents
Use the sha256 shown below as the `base_sha256` value in your writes.
For files that do not exist yet, use the sha256 of empty bytes: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855

## Required Output Format (STRICT — no deviations)
Output ONLY a single JSON object with exactly two keys:
  "summary"  — a brief description of what you changed
  "writes"   — an array of objects, each with:
      "path"        — relative file path (must be in allowed files)
      "base_sha256" — hex SHA256 of the file's current content (from the sha256 values shown above)
      "content"     — the COMPLETE new file content as a string

Do NOT wrap the JSON in markdown fences or add any other text.
Every write must contain the FULL file content, not a partial edit.
