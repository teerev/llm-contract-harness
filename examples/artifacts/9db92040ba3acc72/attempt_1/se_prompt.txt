## Work Order
Title: Add expansion tests and enable pytest in verification
Intent: Create tests/test_expand.py with deterministic unit tests for the expand function, and update scripts/verify.sh to also run pytest.

## Allowed Files (you may ONLY write to these paths)
  - scripts/verify.sh
  - tests/test_expand.py

## Forbidden
  - Do not modify any lsysviz/ files
  - Do not create any files other than tests/test_expand.py

## Notes
tests/test_expand.py must import expand from lsysviz.expand and Grammar from lsysviz.types. Include at least these test cases: (1) expand with 0 iterations returns axiom unchanged, (2) Fibonacci L-system: Grammar(axiom='A', rules={'A':'AB','B':'A'}) at iterations 1 gives 'AB', iterations 2 gives 'ABA', iterations 3 gives 'ABAAB', (3) characters not in rules are preserved (e.g. Grammar(axiom='F+F', rules={'F':'FF'}) at iteration 1 gives 'FF+FF'), (4) empty rules dict leaves axiom unchanged. Update scripts/verify.sh to append 'python -m pytest -q' as the last line (keep the existing compileall line).

## Current File Contents
Use the sha256 shown below as the `base_sha256` value in your writes.
For files that do not exist yet, use the sha256 of empty bytes: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855

### scripts/verify.sh
exists: True
sha256: d0fd94ca9e257781639c70a5dce22ddc0e1f6e5c8f33cb2b36046afa4695499e
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
python -m compileall -q .
```

### tests/test_expand.py
exists: False
sha256: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
(empty / does not exist)

## Required Output Format (STRICT — no deviations)
Output ONLY a single JSON object with exactly two keys:
  "summary"  — a brief description of what you changed
  "writes"   — an array of objects, each with:
      "path"        — relative file path (must be in allowed files)
      "base_sha256" — hex SHA256 of the file's current content (from the sha256 values shown above)
      "content"     — the COMPLETE new file content as a string

Do NOT wrap the JSON in markdown fences or add any other text.
Every write must contain the FULL file content, not a partial edit.
