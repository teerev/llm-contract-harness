## Work Order
Title: Freeze global verification script
Intent: Create scripts/verify.sh that runs 'python -m compileall -q .' to establish the global verification command for all subsequent work orders.

## Allowed Files (you may ONLY write to these paths)
  - scripts/verify.sh

## Forbidden
  - Do not create any files other than scripts/verify.sh
  - Do not add pytest or any test runner yet

## Notes
scripts/verify.sh must contain exactly three lines: '#!/usr/bin/env bash', 'set -euo pipefail', and 'python -m compileall -q .' — nothing else. If the file already exists, overwrite it with this exact content.

## Current File Contents
Use the sha256 shown below as the `base_sha256` value in your writes.
For files that do not exist yet, use the sha256 of empty bytes: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855

### scripts/verify.sh
exists: False
sha256: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
(empty / does not exist)

## Required Output Format (STRICT — no deviations)
Output ONLY a single JSON object with exactly two keys:
  "summary"  — a brief description of what you changed
  "writes"   — an array of objects, each with:
      "path"        — relative file path (must be in allowed files)
      "base_sha256" — hex SHA256 of the file's current content (from the sha256 values shown above)
      "content"     — the COMPLETE new file content as a string

Do NOT wrap the JSON in markdown fences or add any other text.
Every write must contain the FULL file content, not a partial edit.
