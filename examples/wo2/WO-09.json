  "notes": "IMPORTANT: Read mazegen/solve.py, mazegen/generate.py, and mazegen/types.py carefully to learn the EXACT function signatures and type definitions. Use those exact names in all test calls. tests/test_solve.py must import solve from mazegen.solve, generate from mazegen.generate, and Position, Maze, Solution from mazegen.types. Include at least these test cases: (1) solve returns Solution with found=True for a generated perfect maze, (2) path starts at maze.start and ends at maze.end, (3) every consecutive pair in the path is adjacent (Manhattan distance == 1), (4) every consecutive pair in the path corresponds to a passage in maze.passages (no wall crossings), (5) determinism: solving the same maze twice produces the same path, (6) solve on multiple maze sizes (e.g. 3x3, 5x5, 10x10) all succeed. Do NOT guess parameter names — read them from the source."
