Build a terminal-based Wordle-like game using a small built-in word list (5-letter words). The user has 6 guesses. For each guess, print per-letter feedback as correct position / present elsewhere / absent (use simple symbols like G/Y/_. No colors required). Keep the scoring logic pure and separate from CLI. Include tests for scoring with repeated letters (e.g. target “LEVEL” vs guess “HELLO”).
