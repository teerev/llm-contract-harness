  "notes": "Type: additive-feature. Contracts (frozen): segment output format is a list of ((x0,y0),(x1,y1)) float tuples in world coordinates. Deterministic semantics in this step: 'F' draws forward by step (adds one segment), '+' turns left by angle_degrees, '-' turns right by angle_degrees; all other symbols are ignored (no-op). Heading convention is frozen: start at (0.0, 0.0) with heading_degrees=0 pointing up (+Y). Compositionality: isolates geometry interpretation; stack/branching is added later without changing the v1 command semantics."
