  "forbidden": [

  "notes": "Type: hardening. Contracts (preserved): scripts/verify.sh remains the frozen global verification entrypoint. Add one line to run tests using the correct unittest discovery form: `python -m unittest discover -q`. Keep compileall first. Compositionality: makes verification stricter only after tests exist, preserving earlier invariants."
