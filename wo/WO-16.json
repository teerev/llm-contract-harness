  "notes": "Type: documentation. Contracts (preserved): CLI remains `python -m lsysviz render --spec <path> --out <path>`. The JSON spec schema remains frozen as defined in lsysviz/spec.py (required keys only). Determinism is enforced by unit tests and global verification. Compositionality: documentation reduces ambiguity without changing semantics."
